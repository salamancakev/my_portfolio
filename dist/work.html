            My journey in web developing started as a backend developer. I started building Javascript servers using NodeJS
            as my primary tool, then adding middlewares such as Express.js and Sequelize to build REST APIs. Most of my experience
            as a backend developer comes from working using this enviroment. However, most recently I've also started building 
            servers in Python using the Django framework, which has some pretty useful tools right out of the box.

              At first, I started out by using just HTML/CSS/JS (just like this webpage!) together with Bootstrap and some template engines to design and implement UIs. However,
              once projects became more complex I started using Angular as a frontend framework, which helped me develop fast, 
              responsive and reactive UI/UX for my web applications. Then I also learnt React, which is probably the most popular 
              Javascript framework to date, and for a very good reason. The quality that these tools bring to the process of designing
              and developing user friendly applications is one of the many reasons I love working with them.

            Once I got deep into web development there was one question that kept popping up in my head: "What about mobile apps?".
            I've gotten into mobile app development since then and it has become one of my passions. There's something about seeing that
            final product in the App Store/Play Store that really excites me and motivates me to do more. So far, I've been working with a lot of 
            cross-platform Javascript frameworks such as React-Native and Ionic, which allow you to write code and design UIs that work both on Android
            and iOS, without the need of having 2 separate source codes (write once, run anywhere). I've also recently started experimenting
            a little bit with Flutter, which is a cross-platform framework developed by Google using the Dart language, and so far it looks
            very promising.

             While developing both web and mobile apps, I've been able to work with both SQL and NoSQL database management systems (DBMS).
             I've worked in the design and implementation of relational databases using MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server, which have
             allowed me to perform a wide variety of queries on the data. I've also worked with NoSQL technologies aswell, Firebase being 
             the one I've used the most. Its vast API and great integration with other Google services makes it one of the best solutions
             when you need to get an app fast and need an easy and reliable way to store your data.
